I miss my friend.

I miss Kay, yes. I miss being with her, but I miss her as a friend. I miss having her be someone I can turn to. I miss having her in my life with none of these dramatic feelings pinned to her, feelings I have no way of removing.

I'm tired and I'm anxious and I'm tired of being anxious.

I miss my friend.

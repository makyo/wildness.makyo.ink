> To call what I am feeling a 'crush' feels inexact. It is not puppy love. It is not new relationship energy. It is not lust. It is an uncontrollable romantic desire.
>
> It is not grounded in our friendship or my attraction to her. It is more of an obsession. A desperate need for her to feel the same way about me. A craving. A pang. A wildness of the heart that is as frightening as it is pleasant.
>
> It is an unmoored, unmooring thing, drawing me ever upwards in lazy, undirected arcs almost --- *almost* --- against my will, ever closer to the sun.

Six tales of love. Six tales of need, of desire, of how to live with the ones you cannot live without. Sawtooth may be a nothing town in a flyover state, but those that live there are no less real for it. They bear all the same emotions as anyone else, have all the same needs.

**Coming November 1, 2021!**

## Contents

* Jump

  Some folks were just built to jump. What do you do when that gets to be too much?
* Limerent Object

  Dee Kimana, an ex-seminarian coyote, is in love. Maybe. Perhaps? His constant doubts plague him, and as he strives to journal his way towards greater understanding of himself and his emotions, he delves deeper and deeper into the past.
* Gigs

  The gig economy, while useful for providing some income to those in need, comes with its own downfalls and dangers, as Winter soon finds.
* Sorting Laundry

  It's weird what you remember from childhood, isn't it? Almost as weird as what brings those memories to the surface.
* Morning Of

  Surgery and airports --- two places where you give yourself into your trust in professionals. But where, exactly, does that point lie?
* Of Foxes and Milkshakes

  Two foxes, one vanilla-flavored kiss.
